Manicas, retired professor of philosophy at Queens College, City University of New York and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, passed away on December 27 in Honolulu. He is survived by his wife of fifty-five years, Kenoe Kauanoe 'Ti' Manicas, and their son Teddy (Theodore). Their daughter Tautasi died previously. Born into a Greek and Sicilian immigrant family in Binghamton, NY, Manicas was raised in Batavia, NY. He saw active service in the U.S. Air Force in the late 1950s and attained the rank of Captain. He received his BA from Syracuse University, and his MA from the University of Buffalo and his PhD in philosophy from SUNY Buffalo (1963). Professor Manicas moved to Hawaii in 1988 where he served as Professor of Sociology and Director of the Interdisciplinary Studies program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (1988-2011). Early in his career he taught at C.W. Post College and Ohio Wesleyan University. A testimony to his scholarly productivity, Manicas published thirteen books and over fifty papers on realist philosophy, American pragmatism, and social theory including: ""The Death of the State"" (1974); ""A History and Philosophy of the Social Sciences"" (1987); and ""A Realist Philosophy of Science"" (2006). The consistent recipient of teaching awards, Manicas touched the lives of thousands of students. Peter was endowed with a fiery passion for social justice and had a curious mind, a wicked humor, and an open heart. A consummate epicure, he also was an enthusiastic fan of the New York Yankees, Knicks, and Giants, in addition to being a powerful presence in pick-up basketball. Peter was in many ways larger than life and will be irreplaceable. Services will be held at Borthwick Mortuary in Honolulu.<br><br>

He is survived by his brother, Emil Sulser of Maienfeld, Switzerland, wife, Johanna Mooser Sulser, and children Anna (Sulser) Newton, Adrian Sulser, Daniel Sulser, and Bettina (Sulser) Bryant, along with eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Dr. Sulser was born in Grabs, Switzerland and grew up in the town of Maienfeld, amidst his beloved Swiss Alps.

He served as a medical officer in the Swiss Army, married the love of his life, Johanna, and moved with his wife and infant daughter to begin a position as assistant professor at the University of Bern. The family's great American adventure began in the fall of 1958 when Fridolin accepted a post-doctoral fellowship in Neuropsychopharmacology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, M.D. Four years later, he went to Burroughs Wellcome Research Labs in New York as Head of Pharmacology. In 1965 he joined the Vanderbilt University Medical School Faculty as professor and Director of the Pharmacology Research Center, becoming a Professor Emeritus of the University in 2000. Dr. Sulser received many honors during his research career, including the prestigious Anna-Monika Prize, and was a Fellow and President of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology as well as a Fellow of the Collegium International Neuro-Psychopharmacolo- gium. He was a very proud father and grandfather, who celebrated the childrens' successes as they pursued their chosen paths. He found inspiration in nature, literature, philosophy and the fine arts.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman.

Gerry was the beloved husband of Ruth (nee Benjamin), the adored father of Jill Lafer (Barry), Lori (deceased) and Clifford (Wendy) and loving grandfather of Joshua (Marissa), Peter, Casey, Haley and Sara. Beloved brother of Morton, Julius and David. Gerry was a brilliant and dedicated OB/GYN who practiced in Queens, NY. He attended McGill University and McGill Medical School and came to NY for his residency where he met Ruth in 1954 and married in 1955. In his life he was totally devoted to his family and to his patients. In 1976 he was the first obstetrician in New York State to perform a Caesarean Section with the husband present in the delivery room. Those who knew him in the operating room still talk about his tremendous surgical skills and his ability to teach his successors. He cared deeply about women's reproductive healthcare and took great pride in his daughter Jill's position as Board Chair of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. He was one of the founding physicians of Booth Memorial Medical Center, now New York Hospital of Queens. His patients adored him and there are many Gerrys and Geralds named after him. He was a man of determination, integrity, principles and dignity. He believed in mind, body and spirit and practiced this philosophy throughout his life. He horseback rode, skated, skied, played tennis and was often spotted jogging and biking through the streets of Great Neck. He retired in 1990 and traveled the world with his wife, Ruth and spent his time with his grandchildren. He was proud of his knowledge of Shakespeare, constantly quoting him as well as much of classical literature. He was a voracious reader and an astute investor, one of his talents and loves. He was a wordsmith and enjoyed studying the derivation of words and their meanings. His knowledge of history and literature were legendary in our family. He took cooking lessons and enjoyed cooking and wines. He loved the opera, hockey and a good dramatic play. Most of all, he had a great sense of humor and an appreciation and a love of life. He loved his jokes and repeated them often! He will be missed by his family and friends but his memory and life lessons will live on in our hearts forever.

Born in Chicago, IL, February 9, 1919, he lived in Manhattan since 1950. A decorated Army Veteran of more than four years without home leave during World War II, including the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge, he rose to the rank of Sergeant in an artillery division under General Patton. Upon return to the United States, he studied at the University of Chicago and finished with a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Art Institute of Chicago. Beginning in 1955, he was an artist in the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. There, he supported the research of curators and scientists for more than 60 years. He was an extraordinary artist and scientific illustrator and a consummate teacher of photography and illustration to generations of students. His work improved the quality and impact of their publications immensely. Before the existence of computerized fossil images, he developed new techniques for the photographic representation of skeletal material brought from the field by paleontologists. He traveled and painted in France, enjoyed tennis and Classical music, and read widely in the fields of art, history, and philosophy. He needed little more than suggestion to engage in hours of conversation over wine and good cheese. Along with close staff friends and colleagues at the AMNH, Chester is survived by three nephews and several great- nieces and nephews in the greater Chicago area and in Colorado, and cousins in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. He was buried with military honors in a private ceremony Tuesday, October 13 at the Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville, NY.<br><br>

Howard V.<br/><br/> O.F.M., Franciscan priest and Catholic chaplain at Brown University from 1967-1994, died on March 26th in Wyckoff, NJ. He was 88. He is survived by the members of his Franciscan community, loving cousins, nieces and nephews, and is remembered by hundreds of friends. Born William Francis O'Shea in Cambridge, MA, the second son of Edward and Mary O'Shea, he grew up in Belmont, MA with his late brothers, Edward and Robert, and attended Phillips Academy Andover before joining the US Army in 1945. He studied Japanese at Yale University in preparation for deployment in the Pacific before the end of World War II. After leaving the army, he graduated with a degree in English from Harvard College in 1949, and worked as a reporter for United Press International, before he found his lifelong calling in the Franciscan Order, where he was ordained a priest in 1958, taking the name Howard Vincent. He taught philosophy and theology at Saint Joseph's Seminary, Saint Francis College, and Holy Name College, before being named the first full-time Catholic chaplain at Brown, where he served as a source of inspiration, strength, and wisdom for thousands of students for 27 years. During decades of change in American Catholic life beginning with the transformation of the Church spurred by Vatican II and the turbulent 1960s campus protests, Fr. O'Shea was a beacon of compassion and an energetic advocate of spiritual renewal. A supporter of greater ecumenical understanding, he was known for his passionate activism and broad-minded generosity. He loved working with students and was himself always young at heart. Throughout his ministry, he bore witness to Saint Francis' commitment to peace and to love for all those seeking God's mercy. Fr. O'Shea left Brown in 1994 and served as Chaplain for Foreign Students in the Archdiocese of Aix-en- Provence in France, taking daily bike rides around the countryside. During summers, he provided relief for overworked priests in need of vacation by running parishes in England and Sweden, and he touched each new community with his gentleness and joy. Fr. O'Shea retired from full-time ministry in 2011 and lived at Saint Anthony Shrine in Boston until 2015. Even in his last months, he continued to befriend those around him, and he found strength and peace in his faith. Funeral services will be held at St. Anthony Shrine, 100 Arch Street, Boston, MA on Thursday, March 31, 2016.<br><br>

He also worked with the Jewish Policy Center and served on the National Board of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) since 1996 and the National Council of the American Jewish Committee (AJC). From 1989 to 2006, he was on the board of Commentary, a monthly magazine focused on religion, Judaism, politics, social and cultural issues.

Mr. Drake, 96, was the former chairman and chief executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and led the firm 1975 to 1985. He was named ""CEO of the Year"" in 1984 by the Financial Times Magazine, and ""One of the Great American Business Leaders of the 20th Century"" by Harvard Business School. Mr. Drake was also president of Ruben H. Donnelley Corporation from 1972 to 1975. He served on the boards of Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, Baxter International Corporation, Rockwell International Corporation, Irving Trust Bank Corporation, Magnavox Corporation, Seaman's Bank for Savings, and the Desert Caballeros Western Museum. Mr. Drake graduated from Colgate University in 1941 with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and Religion. He also received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Colgate in 1985. He was Chairman Emeritus of Colgate University's Board of Trustees, having served as chairman of the board from 1979-1985. This is a position that was also held by his beloved stepfather Wellington Powell. For his extraordinary volunteer work at Colgate, Mr. Drake received the Ernest T. Stewart Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, the organization's highest award, presented by the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1983. He and his wife, Shirley Grant Drake (who predeceased him in 1993) established the Drake Chair in the Humanities in 1988 and the Library and Scholarship Funds in 1990. In 2004 Mr. Drake and his wife Patricia van Eybergen Drake also established another scholarship fund. As a business leader, Mr. Drake was a life-long champion of the value of having a liberal arts education, which he believed taught critical and independent thinking. Additionally he felt strongly that colleges should encourage students to become bi-lingual in order to be truly prepared to work in our modern interconnected world. During World War II Mr. Drake served as a pilot, rising to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the Air Force Reserve and received the Air Medal and Oak Leaf Cluster while in the 20th Troop Carrier Squadron in the 6th Air Force. While in the South Atlantic Theater he flew two five star Generals: Hap Arnold and George C. Marshall to visit air bases. He flew the Brazilian chief of staff General Gaspar Dutra (later president of Brazil) on a tour of the European Theater of Operations to review Brazilian troops. He also flew the Bob Hope Troupe on an entertainment tour of the 6th Air Force. Mr. Drake was born in Kansas City, MO in 1919. He finished growing up in Caldwell, NJ. He lived in New York, New Hampshire, Los Angeles and Connecticut. In retirement he divided his time between homes in Carpinteria, CA and Wickenburg, AZ. Mr. Drake was a person who would take on challenging projects and bring a combination of imagination, perseverance and dynamic leadership. Those who worked with him benefitted from his willingness to set very high goals and create a strong team spirit. At the same time he adhered to high moral standards, explaining to his teams that, ""We're Boy Scouts."" All who got to know him were blessed by his personal warmth, loyalty and very active sense of humor. He greatly enjoyed people and made deep enduring friendships wherever he lived and worked. Many of those whose lives he touched would attest to the fact that, due to his interest and encouragement, he changed their lives. While, in his last years he was not blessed with good health, his love of life and for the people around him overcame all his adversities. He remained to the end a cheerful and delightful companion in life and will be sorely missed. Mr. Drake was married to Shirley Grant, daughter of William T. Grant, from 1943 until her death in 1993. He married Patricia Van Eybergen of Mexico City, Mexico in 1995 and is not only survived by her but also by his sons Ted, Jeffrey (Barbara Smith) and Andy, as well as by three grandchildren, two great- grandchildren, his brother Donald Powell, along with many nieces and nephews and the children and grand- children of his stepfamily.<br><br>

Mr. Drake, 96, was the former chairman and chief executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and led the firm 1975 to 1985. He was named ""CEO of the Year"" in 1984 by the Financial Times Magazine, and ""One of the Great American Business Leaders of the 20th Century"" by Harvard Business School. Mr. Drake was also president of Ruben H. Donnelley Corporation from 1972 to 1975. He served on the boards of Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, Baxter International Corporation, Rockwell International Corporation, Irving Trust Bank Corporation, Magnavox Corporation, Seaman's Bank for Savings, and the Desert Caballeros Western Museum. Mr. Drake graduated from Colgate University in 1941 with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and Religion. He also received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Colgate in 1985. He was Chairman Emeritus of Colgate University's Board of Trustees, having served as chairman of the board from 1979-1985. This is a position that was also held by his beloved stepfather Wellington Powell. For his extraordinary volunteer work at Colgate, Mr. Drake received the Ernest T. Stewart Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, the organization's highest award, presented by the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1983. He and his wife, Shirley Grant Drake (who predeceased him in 1993) established the Drake Chair in the Humanities in 1988 and the Library and Scholarship Funds in 1990. In 2004 Mr. Drake and his wife Patricia van Eybergen Drake also established another scholarship fund. As a business leader, Mr. Drake was a life-long champion of the value of having a liberal arts education, which he believed taught critical and independent thinking. Additionally he felt strongly that colleges should encourage students to become bi-lingual in order to be truly prepared to work in our modern interconnected world. During World War II Mr. Drake served as a pilot, rising to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the Air Force Reserve and received the Air Medal and Oak Leaf Cluster while in the 20th Troop Carrier Squadron in the 6th Air Force. While in the South Atlantic Theater he flew two five star Generals: Hap Arnold and George C. Marshall to visit air bases. He flew the Brazilian chief of staff General Gaspar Dutra (later president of Brazil) on a tour of the European Theater of Operations to review Brazilian troops. He also flew the Bob Hope Troupe on an entertainment tour of the 6th Air Force. Mr. Drake was born in Kansas City, MO in 1919. He finished growing up in Caldwell, NJ. He lived in New York, New Hampshire, Los Angeles and Connecticut. In retirement he divided his time between homes in Carpinteria, CA and Wickenburg, AZ. Mr. Drake was a person who would take on challenging projects and bring a combination of imagination, perseverance and dynamic leadership. Those who worked with him benefitted from his willingness to set very high goals and create a strong team spirit. At the same time he adhered to high moral standards, explaining to his teams that, ""We're Boy Scouts."" All who got to know him were blessed by his personal warmth, loyalty and very active sense of humor. He greatly enjoyed people and made deep enduring friendships wherever he lived and worked. Many of those whose lives he touched would attest to the fact that, due to his interest and encouragement, he changed their lives. While, in his last years he was not blessed with good health, his love of life and for the people around him overcame all his adversities. He remained to the end a cheerful and delightful companion in life and will be sorely missed. Mr. Drake was married to Shirley Grant, daughter of William T. Grant, from 1943 until her death in 1993. He married Patricia Van Eybergen of Mexico City, Mexico in 1995 and is not only survived by her but also by his sons Ted, Jeffrey (Barbara Smith) and Andy, as well as by three grandchildren, two great- grandchildren, his brother Donald Powell, along with many nieces and nephews and the children and grand- children of his stepfamily. 1/3",NA,"22","The New York Times","2016-06-19T00:00:00Z","article","Classified","Paid Death Notices",NA,"Paid Death Notice","693","Paid Notice: Deaths  DRAKE, HARRINGTON ""DUKE.""

(Barbara) Taylor and Jo Ann Taylor Kindle (Tom Caruso); devoted grandfather of Alison Kindle (Kyle) Hogan, Carolyn Kindle (Adam) Betz,...","<!-- JACK TAYLOR -->TAYLOR--Jack Crawford,<br/><br/> of St. Louis, Missouri, died July 2, 2016, at the age of 94. Beloved father of Andrew C. (Barbara) Taylor and Jo Ann Taylor Kindle (Tom Caruso); devoted grandfather of Alison Kindle (Kyle) Hogan, Carolyn Kindle (Adam) Betz, Christine Taylor (Lee) Broughton, Kelly Taylor and Patricia Taylor (Andy Magee); and cherished great- grandfather of Grace and Amelia Broughton and Kylie Hogan. Taylor was the founder of Enterprise Holdings, which through its Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands is the largest and most comprehensive service provider in the car rental industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, Taylor served his country as a decorated Navy fighter pilot in World War II before returning home to build the company his family still owns and operates. In 1957, he launched a small, auto leasing operation with seven vehicles in the lower level of a Cadillac dealership--expanding to daily car rental a few years later as an additional service to customers. In the decades to come, he turned his start-up into one of the business world's greatest success stories. As the rest of the industry focused on serving airports, Taylor pioneered the ""home city"" car rental market. By renting cars from convenient, neighborhood locations to meet a variety of customer needs, Enterprise quietly but steadily developed a market segment that grew to be as large as or larger than the airport-based rental market. Today, Enterprise Holdings owns three of the most successful car rental brands in the world, a fleet of 1.7 million vehicles and offers extensive car rental and car-sharing services, truck rental, corporate fleet management and retail car sales. Taylor built his company on a simple philosophy: ""Take care of your customers and your employees first, and the profits will follow."" And indeed they did. Over the years, his passion for the business was equaled only by his devotion to his family and his generosity to his beloved home town. Through the years, Taylor--whose charitable giving ranked him No. 11 on The Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2015 ""Philanthropy 50"" list of America's top donors--made many notable private contributions to several of St. Louis's leading civic and cultural not-for-profit institutions, notably the St. Louis Public Schools Foundation, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Missouri Botanical Garden, Forest Park Forever and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Other local beneficiaries of his family's and his company's generosity have included St. Louis Children's Hospital, the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Science Center, Harris-Stowe State University, Saint Louis University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Our Little Haven and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. In his integrity, optimism and spirit of service, Jack Taylor was a shining example of the ""Greatest Generation."" With his passing, St. Louis has lost one of its greatest friends and benefactors. Funeral service private. The family requests that donations be made to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, 975 N. Warson Road, St. Louis, MO 63132; Forest Park Forever, 5595 Grand Drive, St. Louis, MO 63103; or the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, 718 North Grand Blvd., St. Louis, MO, 63103.

Beloved father of Andrew C. (Barbara) Taylor and Jo Ann Taylor Kindle (Tom Caruso); devoted grandfather of Alison Kindle (Kyle) Hogan, Carolyn Kindle (Adam) Betz, Christine Taylor (Lee) Broughton, Kelly Taylor and Patricia Taylor (Andy Magee); and cherished great- grandfather of Grace and Amelia Broughton and Kylie Hogan. Taylor was the founder of Enterprise Holdings, which through its Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands is the largest and most comprehensive service provider in the car rental industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, Taylor served his country as a decorated Navy fighter pilot in World War II before returning home to build the company his family still owns and operates. In 1957, he launched a small, auto leasing operation with seven vehicles in the lower level of a Cadillac dealership--expanding to daily car rental a few years later as an additional service to customers. In the decades to come, he turned his start-up into one of the business world's greatest success stories. As the rest of the industry focused on serving airports, Taylor pioneered the ""home city"" car rental market. By renting cars from convenient, neighborhood locations to meet a variety of customer needs, Enterprise quietly but steadily developed a market segment that grew to be as large as or larger than the airport-based rental market. Today, Enterprise Holdings owns three of the most successful car rental brands in the world, a fleet of 1.7 million vehicles and offers extensive car rental and car-sharing services, truck rental, corporate fleet management and retail car sales. Taylor built his company on a simple philosophy: ""Take care of your customers and your employees first, and the profits will follow."" And indeed they did. Over the years, his passion for the business was equaled only by his devotion to his family and his generosity to his beloved home town. Through the years, Taylor--whose charitable giving ranked him No. 11 on The Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2015 ""Philanthropy 50"" list of America's top donors--made many notable private contributions to several of St. Louis's leading civic and cultural not-for-profit institutions, notably the St. Louis Public Schools Foundation, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Missouri Botanical Garden, Forest Park Forever and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Other local beneficiaries of his family's and his company's generosity have included St. Louis Children's Hospital, the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Science Center, Harris-Stowe State University, Saint Louis University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Our Little Haven and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. In his integrity, optimism and spirit of service, Jack Taylor was a shining example of the ""Greatest Generation."" With his passing, St. Louis has lost one of its greatest friends and benefactors.

She was born July 31, 1919 in New York City to Theresa LaGumina Barbieri and Frank Barbieri, both of whom were born in Italy. Frances was raised in Queens, New York and was an honors graduate of Richmond Hill High School, Hunter College and New York University. She played a piano recital at Carnegie Hall in 1933, worked at the 1939 World's Fair and helped ship tanks from New York to Europe during WW II. Frances was predeceased by her parents, her beloved sister Eleanor, and her loving husband of 55 years, Rocco J. Sergi. She leaves her two devoted sons and their spouses, Vincent A.F. Sergi and Debbie (Chicago), Theodore S. Sergi and Barbara (West Hartford, CT), four treasured grandsons: Nicholas and spouse Jennifer Mabary (San Antonio), Gregory (Los Angeles), Justin (New York City) and Julian (Hollywood) and one very wonderful great-granddaughter, Carolyn Marcella Sergi (San Antonio). Frances was one of the greatest school teachers of modern history; elected as the first recipient of the Kew Forest School Hall of Fame in 2004 after 40+ years of teaching fourth grade. Her teaching of reading, writing, math, the multiplication tables, nature (bird projects), the arts, and thesis-like projects for 10-year-olds is legendary. She has been described by her former students as ""stern but loving, tough but fair, demanding but praising"" with a ""no-nonsense classroom atmosphere that demanded that one must respect all others."" Her philosophy was always one of ""You can do it."" The Sergi family would like all her former students to know that she was as great a mom and grandma as she was a teacher. At age 81 she retired from teaching and joined the Kew Forest School Development Office, working until age 88 cajoling her former pupils into making contributions. Frances loved music of all kinds: classical, opera, Frank Sinatra and The Mills Brothers. She was passionate about musical theater and made costumes for school play productions for decades. She loved history and her visits with Rocco to America's great historical sites. And she was proud of her hometown of New York City, its excitement and its international sounds and flavors. She also believed in the curative powers of witch hazel. Frances made a lasting impression on everyone she met, making everyone around her feel included and happy. Frances was devoted to the Church of the Resurrection, Richmond Hill and St. Luke's Church, Forest Hills, and served both in many capacities. Frances was very thankful to the devoted staff of The McAuley and St. Mary Home, West Hartford, CT. where she spent the last eight good years of her 97. Her last five years were especially joyful thanks to her faithful assistants Carmen Baig, Raenette Bowens and Ruth Daley. Mom, we are doing our best in your absence. We will remember to throw cold water on our faces and get back to working hard and helping others, just like you did. Ci vediamo, Nonna. A celebration of Frances' life will be held in Forest Hills and Richmond Hill, NY in October. Memorial contributions may be made to the Kew Forest School, 119-17 Union Turnpike, Forest Hills, NY 11375. Condolences may be sent to The Sergi family at 11 Castlewood Rd., West Hartford, CT 06107. Taylor & Modeen Funeral Home, West Hartford has care of services.<br><br>

She has been described by her former students as ""stern but loving, tough but fair, demanding but praising"" with a ""no-nonsense classroom atmosphere that demanded that one must respect all others."" Her philosophy was always one of ""You can do it."" The Sergi family would like all her former students to know that she was as great a mom and grandma as she was a teacher. At age 81 she retired from teaching and joined the Kew Forest School Development Office, working until age 88 cajoling her former pupils into making contributions. Frances loved music of all kinds: classical, opera, Frank Sinatra and The Mills Brothers. She was passionate about musical theater and made costumes for school play productions for decades. She loved history and her visits with Rocco to America's great historical sites. And she was proud of her hometown of New York City, its excitement and its international sounds and flavors. She also believed in the curative powers of witch hazel. Frances made a lasting impression on everyone she met, making everyone around her feel included and happy. Frances was devoted to the Church of the Resurrection, Richmond Hill and St. Luke's Church, Forest Hills, and served both in many capacities. Frances was very thankful to the devoted staff of The McAuley and St. Mary Home, West Hartford, CT. where she spent the last eight good years of her 97. Her last five years were especially joyful thanks to her faithful assistants Carmen Baig, Raenette Bowens and Ruth Daley. Mom, we are doing our best in your absence. We will remember to throw cold water on our faces and get back to working hard and helping others, just like you did. Ci vediamo, Nonna. A celebration of Frances' life will be held in Forest Hills and Richmond Hill, NY in October. Memorial contributions may be made to the Kew Forest School, 119-17 Union Turnpike, Forest Hills, NY 11375. Condolences may be sent to The Sergi family at 11 Castlewood Rd., West Hartford, CT 06107. Taylor & Modeen Funeral Home, West Hartford has care of services. 1/3",NA,"20","The New York Times","2016-07-10T00:00:00Z","article","Classified","Paid Death Notices",NA,"Paid Death Notice","568","Paid Notice: Deaths  SERGI, FRANCES B",NA
