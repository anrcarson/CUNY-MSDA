First, load the RMySQL library.
```{r load_library, eval=FALSE}
library('RMySQL')
```


Then connect to the MySQL database (Note: password has been changed to "password") and change to the "movierating" database.
```{r connect, eval = FALSE}
mydb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='password', host='localhost')
dbSendQuery(mydb, "USE movierating")
```


Then pull in the movierating table results into a dataframe and view results.
```{r pull, eval=FALSE}
df<-dbFetch(dbSendQuery(mydb,"SELECT * FROM movierating;"))
```
```{r view, eval=FALSE}
df
```


Finally, disconnect the MySQL connection and clean up.
```{r clean, eval=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(mydb)
mydb<-NA
```
